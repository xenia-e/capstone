Step 1 - Creating a Simple Machine Learning Model

DUE 10/24/21

We are creating a very simple machine learning model that will fit our data and return a label. At this stage, we are not concerned with the accuracy of our model. We will improve our model accuracy as we continue to explore the data and structure our model. 

### Process:
1. Ask the question 
2. Description of column types
3. Import Libraries 
4. Load the data from the database 
5. Look at shape and summarize dataset 
6. Look at visualizations to explore the data
7. Pre-process the Data for our model
8. Encode Object Data 
9. Select features and targets
10. Scale the data
11. Split test and train 
12. Build our model (Random Forest Classifer and Neural Network)


### Questions:
What does the machine learning model look like? Supervised? Unsupervised? Is the data structred? How will you process the data for the machine learning model? What statistical test will you do? Roadmap for intentions. 

#### Which model did you choose and why? 
* We need to visualize our data to explore it and determine the best statistical test and training model to use. 

* We will be using a supervised machine learning model because we already know what data we are trying to predict.

* If the data is structured tabular data, we would like to use a Random Forest Classifier. This is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression that take in many small decision trees for training for a more accurate output.

* We would also like to use a neural network and compare the accuracy and results. 

#### How are you training your model? 
* Statistical Test: TBD
* X: Input Data from our DataFrame
* Y: Medals Received

#### What is the model's accuracy? 
* TBD

#### How does this model work? 
* TBD


10/23/21 
* We have set up a machine learning outline model to utilize when we receive data
* Model is set up with sample code to adjust once data is prepared

10/24/21
* We have added the Random Forest Classifier and Neural Network code as potential models
* Awaiting database information and code

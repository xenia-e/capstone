# Machine Learning Model Outline

We have built a basic machine learning model to take in sample data and test accuracy. Please find the code [here]().

## Process:
1. Ask the question 
2. Description of column types
3. Load Libraries 
4. Load the dataset from database 
5. Look at shape and summarize dataset 
6. Look at visualizations to explore the data
7. Pre-process the Data for our model
8. Select features and targets
9. Encode the data
10. Scale the data
11. Split test and train 
12. Build our ensemble 


### Questions:
What does the machine learning model look like? Supervised? Unsupervised? Is the data structred? How will you process the data for the machine learning model? What statistical test will you do? Roadmap for intentions. 

#### Which model did you choose and why? 
We need to visualize our data to explore it and determine the best statistcal test and training model to use. 

If the data is structured tabular data, we would like to use a Random Forest Classifier. This is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression that take in many small decision trees for training for a more accurate output.

#### How are you training your model? 
Statistical Test: TBD
X: Input Data
Y: Output Data

#### What is the model's accuracy? 
TBD

#### How does this model work? 
TBD

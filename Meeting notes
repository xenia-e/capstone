Notes of Second meeting 10.21.21:

Topic
 - How does COVID has affected remote employment: Geographic (location), salary, mobility, discrepancy in income levels

Questions to answer with the analysis
  - Likelihood of someone working remotely has with class, income levels
  - How remote working affected geographics (economic impact, location)
  - How the situations affected the population in New York City
  - Where do they move to 
  - How this affected the housing market, local markets
  - How many jobs pivoted to remote working 
  - Model: Determine with our model is if somebody has moved or not, and if they moved what variables have (age, salary, location). Why did they leave? 
  - How we can use this model in the future. How what we have learned can be applied in the future.
  - Since Covid stated how many remote jobs are available (hybrid)
  - What type of industries have grown 
- How we would be tracking our data 

Narrowing the topic:
  - Answering (some of) the shareholder pitch 
  - What does your group hope to achieve 
  - To be able to determine the likelihood of someone moving out of the city 
  - High mobility groups moving due to a crisis 
  - What steps are being taken to achieve this 

Current progress 
 - Assigned Square, Triangle, Circle and X roles 
 - Narrowed the project topic (failed we had to change the topic because lack of data)

Point you plan on being at by next week 
 - Cleaning datasets 
 - Maching learning
